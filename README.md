# gene-ig-identify

This repository provides a machine learning framework to identify immunoglobulin (Ig) domains in human genes using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN).

## Features
- Processes human gene sequences into graph representations
- Trains a GIN model to classify Ig domains
- Predicts Ig domains in new sequences
